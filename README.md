# Web Workers

This assignment is about web workers and their importance.

## Description

As we know JS is single threaded language. It doesnâ€™t support multi-threading. For achieving the functionality similar to multi threading we use web workers. We assign any task to a web worker and it completes that task in background without stopping the main thread. In this way we become able to do multiple tasks at same time. Important thing to note is that the web workers do not have access to DOM or parent page.
